# Machine Learning Project | Predicting Diabetes Risk

# Overview
This project predicts diabetes risk levels based on various health indicators like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and lifestyle habits. Using Random Forest, we achieved a high-accuracy classification model for early diabetes detection.

# Dataset
The dataset contains medical and lifestyle features of individuals.

# Key attributes: 
Age, BMI, Glucose Level, Insulin, Blood Pressure, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Physical Activity.

# Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
* Machine Learning (Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)
